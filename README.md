## Introduction
ReciPal is a recipe-sharing service allowing for sharing of cooking recipes. The core focus of ReciPal is allowing users to select key ingredients from a given recipe, allowing them to view alternative ingredients to cater to their preferences, allergies, intolerances, and home-availability.

This project aims to enhance the user experience by creating a sophisticated recipe website that optimizes discovery, contribution, and management of recipes. The platform seamlessly integrates advanced database systems with user-centred design, and adaptive web technologies including HTML, CSS, and PHP. This ensures to establish an efficient and engaging platform. This project is designed for students and people who find it hard cooking and not knowing the recipes or where to get them from.
